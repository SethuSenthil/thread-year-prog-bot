# ðŸ§µ Instagram Threads Year Progress Bot ðŸ¤–

Instagram Threads is a social media app developed by Instagram (Meta), designed to replicate the functionality of Twitter. It allows users to post text oriented posts.

## Technologies Used

- **Deno**: Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. It is used in this project to run the server-side code and handle various tasks, such as scheduling and sending messages.

- **npm:threads-api**: The `threads-api` package is a library used to interact with the unofficial Threads API. It provides functionalities to post and write threads on Instagram.

- **deno_cron**: The `deno_cron` package is used for scheduling tasks at specific intervals. In this project, it is used to schedule the execution of the `getProgress` function to provide regular updates.

- **dotenv**: The `dotenv` package is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file. It helps in managing sensitive information, such as API keys or access tokens.

- **TelegramBot**: The `TelegramBot` library is utilized to integrate with the Telegram messaging platform. It enables the bot to send messages and updates to my phone so I can remotely keep track of whats going on.

- **path**: The `path` module from the Deno standard library is used to handle file paths and join directories in a platform-independent manner.

## How it Works

The Instagram Threads app is built using Deno, which serves as the runtime for running the server-side code. The code is responsible for tracking the progress of the current year and month, generating progress bars, and posting updates to the designated chat ID on Telegram.

The `getProgress` function calculates the elapsed time and percentage completed for both the current year and month. It compares these values with the previous post data stored in a JSON file. If there is a difference, it generates a progress bar and posts the update to Telegram using the `postThread` function.

To provide regular updates, the `getProgress` function is initially called immediately, and then scheduled to run at 12:02 AM (midnight) every day using the `cron` function from `deno_cron`.

## Running the Code

To run the code, perform the following steps:

1. Install Deno on your system (if not already installed).
2. Clone the project repository.
3. Set the required environment variables (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`) in a `.env` file.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the command: `deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net index.ts`.
